# Ragu Bolognese

## What You'll Need
* 1 Yellow Onion - Diced
* 1 Celery Stalk - Diced
* 1 Carrot - Diced
* EVOO
* 1lb of 80/20 Ground Chuck
* Salt
* Pepper
* Basil
* Marjoram
* Oregano
* 3oz Pancetta - Diced
* 1 and 1/2 cups Pinot Grigio
* 3 oz Tomato Paste (or 1 small can, add another if you like it more tomatoey)
* 1 Bay Leaf
* Pinch of grated Nutmeg
* 2-3 cups Low-Sodium Chicken Broth
* 1 cup Whole Milk
* About 1lb of Tagliatelle, Papardelle, or Rotini
* 2-3oz of grated Parmesano Reggiano

## Prep
1. Make a mirepoix from the onion, carrot, and celery and set it aside
2. In a large, thick-bottomed pot on medium-high heat, add your EVOO, then add the beef and lightly season it with salt. Just lightly brown it, it's ok if it's still a bit pink. Once it's done, transfer it using a slotted spoon to a bowl and set it aside for a few minutes.
3. Wipe out the pot (or don't if you want to re-use some of the grease) and add the diced pancetta. Cook it until it's a little crispy.
4. Add the mirepoix to the pot with the pancetta. Sweat the veggies with the pancetta for about 8 minutes until the veggies are somewhat translucent and smell amazing.
5. Re-add the ground chuck to the pot, and dump in the Pinot Grigio. (If the wine boils, remove the pot from the heat, reduce your burner heat and then place the pot back on once you're sure the wine will simmer, at most).
7. Now, break up the beef into small bits, and cook it until the wine is nearly evaporated. This should take about 15 minutes on medium-high heat. Mind it occasionally so that nothing sticks to the bottom of the pot.
8. Once the wine has cooked down, add the bay leaf, tomato paste, nutmeg, salt, pepper, marjoram, basil, and oregano (sparingly for now). Now, fry the tomato paste until it's fairly dark and everything is covered. This shouldn't take but 5 minutes on medium-high heat.
9. Now, pour the chicken broth and the milk into the pot, reduce the heat to Low, and cook the sauce for a minimum of 2.5 hours, or at least until the meat is very soft. Once this is all done, the sauce texture will be somewhat like a sloppy joe. This is ok and is what you want.
    1. FYI: If all the liquid evaporates from the sauce before the minimum 2.5 hours, add about 1/2 cup of chicken broth and continue to cook. 
    2. This is when you want to season to taste, so add salt, pepper and extra seasoning at this stage.
10. Boil your pasta in salted water (do not use oil) until it's al dente, or until it's cooked to your preference.
11. Then drain your pasta, do not rinse it or shock it with cold water.
12. Add your pasta into the sauce pot, add about 1/2 cup of the pasta water to the sauce pot and toss the noodles in the sauce.
13. Warm up the sauce on medium heat with the noodles in, tossing constantly until the sauce has thickened somewhat.
    1. I like to add red pepper flake at this point, but you don't need to.
14. Eat.
